            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to Pace Animal Association! We're a club at Pace
              University dedicated to creating a community for like-minded
              animal lovers and a platform for advocacy regarding animals! If
              you're looking for a club where you can bond with people over a
              shared love for pets, volunteering for animals, or donating to
              endangered animal causes, then consider attending one of our
              events. We aim to connect students to animal volunteering centers,
              shelters, and charities, all while sharing a few cat or dog memes
              along the way!
            </p>
            <p>
              We are in the process of filing for 501(c)(3) status as a
              nonprofit, and renovate our platform to include a donations
              feature directly to our partnered charities! Stay tuned!

              <h3>Dog Toys from Old Clothes</h3>
              <p>
                Members brought in old articles of clothing to learn to turn
                them into dog toys, which were then donated to numerous
                charities and shelters. We hosted a mini arts and crafts
                workshop with some materials being provided to learn to
                disassemble and repurpose apparel into toys.

              <h3>Sea Turtles Fundraiser</h3>
              <p>
                Members helped create goodie bags to be sold during a fundraiser
                dedicated to raising funds for endangered sea turtle species.
                Goodie bags consisted of pins, plushies, and snacks; a total of
                $400 was generated to donate to a predetermined charity.
